      <description>Summary I have managed to grab Questions and Answers from scanned PDF version of real grammar book and create an Anki deck from it. Although OCR was not perfect at all I was able to restore 50% of all exercises using some smart reg ex replacements in vim editor. Publishing final deck is not possible because of legal issues but I have decided to publish this how-to.
 Update: I have decided to provide copy of the deck to anybody who will prove that is owner of the book.</description>
