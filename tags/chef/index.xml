      <description>DevOps workshop with Chef At the end of the 2015 I was asked by IBM colleague from Poland who is leading a team of Java developers to develop and deliver a DevOps workshop.
I took a challenge and delivered March 9-10 in Warsaw personally. The slides from the event are available at: http://slides.com/petrmichalec/devops-workshop
Agenda At first quite challenge as the DevOps topic is so wide, right? Finally I narrowed agenda to some &amp;ldquo;devops&amp;rdquo; discussion, Chef.</description>
